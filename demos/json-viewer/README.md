# restifydb API Browser Demo Application #

restifydb is a framework that is able to automatically map databases (from all major database engine providers) to 
REST web services. The web services can output XML or JSON. It leverages data discovery. It has advanced capabilities 
as automatic query expansion (joining based on foreign keys), automatic inward references, automatic data discovery, 
filtering, sorting and out of the box CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete data). Most of these features 
are used by our demo application built using restifydb. It also features an admin panel which makes configuring it 
quite easy.

The API browser helps users understand how restifydb exposes data. It is basically a thin layer on top of the RESTful 
web services generated by the framework which presents the JSON data in a human-readable fashion. The same result can be
 obtained by browsing the API with the JSONView Firefox extension.
 
In order to make this application work, just modify the Config.php and make it point to the URL where restifydb 
exposes the data sources as REST services.
